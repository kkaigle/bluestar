      <div><b>Welcome</b><br>
   BlueStar is a fictional, worldwide virtual airline. Founded in February 2021, we just celebrated our first year of operations and we look forward to the future. BlueStar has recently adopted the use of FSHub as a central tracking method, to unify our multi-platform airline. <br>
          
 <br>Before this conversion, BlueStar had logged over 11,441 hours of flight on 4,881 flights moving 66,657,314kg of cargo and 253,440 passengers. 
          <br><br><br>
          <b>New Interface</b><br>
          BlueStar has recently opted to offer 2 options of flight for our pilots. The airline has adopted the persistent economic manager called Fly The World- a completely free VA manager, with a virtual economy comprised of thousands of airlines and pilots. The wonderful team at Aiena e.V. power the platform and work hard for our enjoyment. Our legacy pilots remain on the payware, subscription based platform but have the option to migrate to the new platform. Our goal to create a completely free, virtual airline while challenging ourselves in a persistent economic airline manager. <br><br><br>
