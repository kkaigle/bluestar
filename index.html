      <div><b>Welcome to BlueStar</b><br>
   We are a fictional, worldwide virtual airline. We operate in North America, Europe, Central America and charter operations in Papa New Guinea. With a fleet that ranges from 
   Cessna 172's, 208s, all the way up to the Boeing 737 and 767, we have an aircraft ready for almost any type of pilot. 
   <br><br>
          
     Founded in February 2021, we just celebrated our first year of operations and we look forward to the future. We operate on all flight sim platforms (FSX, X-Plane, Prepar3D, and
   Microsoft Flight Simulator. 
      <br><br>
      
      What makes BlueStar a little unique, is that we operate in a persistent economy that is shared with other airlines also. This allows pilots flexibility of flying 
      any airframe available in our fleet, but also to earn the airline money by doing outsourced jobs from other airlines. 
      <br><br>
          
      Utilizing a lightweight tracking software, its easy for pilots to start the flight, resume flights and submit PIREPS. We understand that taking on this type of flying can
      be a little more challenging, which is why we have nearly 24 hour coverage from staff and dispatchers to assist you along the way. Our staff is comprised of members around
      the world to ensure requests and issues are dealth with in a timely manner. 
          
      <br><br>    
      If you are interested in learning more, check us out
      at our discord. We welcome all levels of simmers, from novice to senior captains. We have a staff member ready to get you onboard and flying for us today!</div>
