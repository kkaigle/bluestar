  <p><b>1.1 Code Of Conduct</b><br>
     All BlueStar pilots and staff are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is respectful and constructive. Our discord is a very diverse place, and 
      respect for all is paramount in our airline. Content that is divisive, hateful, derogotory or illegal will be dealt with promptly by a staff member. This will be
      grounds for possible immediate dismissal from the airline without rehire rights.<br><br>
      <b>1.2 General Requirements</b><br>
      Pilots must own a copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, X-Plane 11, FSX or Prepar3d V3+. <br>
      Must be a member in the discord and participation in the discord community beneficial to membership retention.<br><br>
      <b>1.3 Community Guidelines</b><br>
      The discord is a place for simulator pilots and community members to chat, share experience and help users. We do not tolerate any sort of disrespect or hate regardless
    who it is directed towards. Directors are not always present, and cannot monitor every chat constantly. Any instances that violate these rules please direct message LordRupert
    or Alex immediately.</p>

    <p><b>2.1 General Fly The World Information</b><br>
     Pilots wishing to fly using FTW need to register and download client software at https://www.ftw-sim.de. All accounts will be provisioned roughly daily.<br><br>
        <b>2.2 Pilot Qualifications</b><br>
        Pilots in FTW earn licenses by flight time. In a VA, those restrictions are eased and you are able to fly any aircraft available from the airline. The airline can dispatch
        a job for any pilot holding the required license, plus one level of qualification (Pilot holds PPL, may be dispatched up to CPL flight). For pilots that do not hold
        the license one above, the airline will post the job to the outsourcing market for a lower than average value to ensure the pilot has a fair attempt at getting the job. 
        Job licenses in FTW are as follows:<br><br>
        <b>Private Pilots License: 0-100hrs<br>  Commercial Pilots License: 100-250hrs<br>  Multi-Crew Pilots License: 250-750hrs<br>   Airline Transport Pilots License: 750+ hours</b><br><br>
    <b>2.3 Currency</b><br>
    BlueStar does not mandate any minimum flight hours in the VA, however we do keep track of inactivity within the community and on flight logs. We fully support a real life first
    mentality, but we hope that is discussed with directors prior to an extended absense. In order to better keep track of membership and activity, pilots that have not been active 
    within 30 days will be marked as "currency lapsed" in the community discord. After 60 days of no response or activity, pilots will move to the inactive roster and potentially
    removed from the airline. Pilots are always welcome back, as long as they did not violate TOS or community standards. Pilots will be reinstated otherwise upon contact with a 
    manager. <br><br>
        <b>2.4 Dispatching</b><br>
    Pilots can request a dispatch in discord, using the #dispatching-ftw channel. Requests for flights beyong 12 hours in advance will typically not be fulfilled immediately
    unless circumstances warrant (unavailable managers at desired time, ect...). Please notify which airframe, ICAO-ICAO in your request for a dispatcher to rapidly fulfill the
        request.<br><br></p>

        <button type="cbutton" class="collapsible"><b>Section 3: OnAir Operations</b></button>
<div class="collapsecontent">
    <p><b>3.1 General OnAir Information</b><br>
    OnAir recently underwent an economic model change which forces us to operate in a way to ensure that the VA is profitable. While the main goal is to have fun, we must enforce
    some structure in order to support all pilots accross the airline. This means that many aircraft will be shared, or pooled for pilots to share now.<br><br>
        <b>3.2 Fleet Management</b><br>
        Our fleet is mainly comprised of medium to long haul airliners. These aircraft are expensive, and must be utilized to their potential in order to ensure the VA can
    continue to support them, and add new aircraft to the fleet. These aircraft are the workhorses of the fleet. <br><br>
        <b>3.3 Dispatching</b><br>
        We do not force dispach typically in OnAir. Pilots are generally free to chose any of our FBO jobs available, by using the airline console to search "FBO Queries". Pilots
    will not take jobs in advance, take more than their plane can carry or cause an issue where the VA will suffer penalties due to mismanagement of job acceptance. Repeat offenses
    will result in the pilots dispatch privileges being revoked.<br><br>
        <b>3.4 FBO Network</b><br>
        The FBO network is largely centered on North America and Europe, which reflects our pilot demographics. FBOs remain fairly constant, with some changes made every 1-2 months
    to create new destinations, remove unpopular destinations and give pilots an opportunity to fly to new scenery. There will be periodic inquiries by the directors for 
    suggestions, but these are welcome at any time. The planes we provide are required to adhere to the FBO network unless the aircraft is not supported by the FBO Quereies. In 
    this case, a director will inform you of this. If you happen to notice that your airframe is no longer supported on the FBO network, please ping a director. Any off-FBO netowrk
    flying must be reviewed by a director in advance to ensure it will not harm the VA financially.</p>
