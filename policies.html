            BlueStar Airlines operates with a real life first mentality, however, since we operate in a economic persistent environment, we must have some boundaries set in order to ensure fairness for all pilots. Please visit the topics below to learn about how
            we operate and expectations of being a BlueStar pilot. Please review the airline policies below and if you have any questions, feel free to speak with us directly!
            <br><br>
            <b>General Policies</b><br><br>
            1. Code of Conduct<br><br>

All BlueStar pilots and staff are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that aligns with the following rules. Violations of these rules will have swift action taken. The Code of Conduct is simple, yet failure to follow will result in warnings and ultimate dismissal from the VA after repeated offenses.
<br><br>
With a large group of pilots from around the world, BlueStar is a very diverse VA. Respect to all is crucial, both in and out of the VA discussion channels. Any reports of distasteful comments will result in possible immediate dismissal.
Any content referencing divisive, derogatory, bigoted, illegal activities will be immediately removed from discussions. Any violators of this will receive one warning prior to dismissal. On some occasions, the dismissal will be immediate.
BlueStar is regularly used by VATSIM and IVAO users. You are fully expected to act according to their rules, in addition to upholding a high standard of respect and courtesy on those networks.
BlueStar is generally used to promote flight simulation and to enhance that experience. We are not an organization used for self-promotion or political activities.
<br><br>
            2. Membership Requirements
          <br><br>
            BlueStar attempts to accomodate players of all styles. Whether you are new to flight simulation, or a career long airline captain, you will fit in at BlueStar. 
            A few simple requirements:<br><br>
            a. Must own applicable flight simulator. Eligible simulators are X-Plane, Prepar3D, Microsoft Flight Simulator.<br>
            b. Ability to maintain currency within the airline, or remain a social member without currency requirements.<br>
            c. Must not have been previously dismissed from a VA for unacceptable behavior.<br>
            d. Must join the VA discord channel, as that is the primary method of communication.<br><br>
            
            3. VATSIM, IVAO, PilotsEdge
         <br><br>
            We do not require pilots to use online, virtual ATC but it is encouraged. We have many pilots within the VA with a lot of real time experience, as well as in the virtual skies using these services. If you are interested in learning, do not be shy to ask! 
            <br><br>
            4. Currency Requirements<br><br>
            BlueStar will always support real life first, and respects our pilots personal needs outside of the simualtion. For this, we ask that if you take an extended break 
            from the VA, to just notify a director of this so we can properly account for pilot activity. Further currency requirements are dictated depending on the platform you
            fly within. <b>FlyTheWorld</b> pilots do not have currency minumims to maintain. The VA currenty uses a shared fleet policy in FTW so there is no minimums. 
            <b>OnAir</b> pilots are required to fly at least 5 times weekly, in order to maintain exclusive access to a plane. If a pilot is unable to achieve that, they
            will be afforded the rights to the shared fleet in <b>OnAir</>.<br><br>
