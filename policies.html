            BlueStar Airlines operates with a real life first mentality, however, since we operate in a economic persistent environment, we must have some boundaries set in order to ensure fairness for all pilots. Please visit the topics below to learn about how
            we operate and expectations of being a BlueStar pilot. Please review the airline policies below and if you have any questions, feel free to speak with us directly!
            <br><br>
            <b>General Policies</b><br><br>
            1. Code of Conduct<br><br>

All BlueStar pilots and staff are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that aligns with the following rules. Violations of these rules will have swift action taken. The Code of Conduct is simple, yet failure to follow will result in warnings and ultimate dismissal from the VA after repeated offenses.
<br><br>
With a large group of pilots from around the world, BlueStar is one of the most diverse VAâ€™s. Respect to all is crucial, both in and out of the VA discussion channels. Any reports of distasteful comments will result in possible immediate dismissal.
Any content referencing divisive, derogatory, bigoted, illegal activities will be immediately removed from discussions. Any violators of this will receive one warning prior to dismissal. On some occasions, the dismissal will be immediate.
BlueStar is regularly used by VATSIM and IVAO users. You are fully expected to act according to their rules, in addition to upholding a high standard of respect and courtesy on those networks.
BlueStar is generally used to promote flight simulation and to enhance that experience. We are not an organization used for self-promotion or political activities.
