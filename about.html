<b>Founding</b><br>
BlueStar was founded in February 2021, by 2 pilots from a previous VA that went defunct. Since then we have grown to be a very active and VA that 
has all levels of experience. Whether you are a novice flight simmer, or a real life airline Captain, we value your membership and contributions. 
<br><br>

<b>BlueStar's Mission</b><br>

BlueStar operates in persistent realms that add to the flight simulator experience. We are a free-to-play VA that does not mimick any
real world operations. The name "BlueStar" is derived from the 1987 movie, "Wall Street". 
While we operate in persistent economies, we strive to give pilots the flexibility to fly whenever works for them. 
We maintain a "real life first" mentality and our currency requirements allow for extended leave and casual flying. 
<br><br>
<b>The Future</b>
<br>
BlueStar's success is directly attributed to our pilots. Without a force of determined, dedicated and enthusiastic pilots, our VA would not succeed. 
We aim to give pilots guidance and a reason to fly. Our goal is to continue to grow our presence in the community, and be a
renowned VA.
