            BlueStar is a fictional airline, derived from the 1987 film "Wall Street". <br><br> BlueStar Airlines has seen decades of turbulent times, ranging from an aircraft crash in 1984, repeated stock dumps, lack of working capital and a revolving
            door of management. After the 1984 crash, all hope seemed to have been lost with BlueStar. The FAA released findings of that tragic crash, stating that BlueStars Maintenance program was not actually at fault as once thought. The incident was
            caused by a defective manufacturer latch on the airframe.
            <br><br> After the FAA gave BlueStar the clearance to take to the skies again, wall-street stockbroker Bud Fox started pushing the stock “BST” on his clients based on insider information. Fox’s father was an aircraft maintenance supervisor
            and union leader for the company. Fox managed to catch the ear of wealthy Wall Street investor Gordon Gekko. Even after the exoneration, BlueStar continued to struggle filling routes. Fox finally convinced Gekko to acquire BlueStar, and provide
            it with a second chance at success. Gekko was wise to this, and decided to use his buying power to purchase the company in the name of greed. The plan to gut the company, drain pension funds and dismantle the union was leaked out. Fox had
            to act fast in order to prevent his father and the many long-time employees of BlueStar from losing everything. Fox contacted Gekko’s top enemy, another wealthy investor by the name of Sir Larry Wildman.
            <br><br> After this exchange, Fox was arrested on the charge of insider trading, but talked his way into being an informant for the FTC. While wearing a wire, he captured an admission of guilt from Gekko, which in turn set Bud free, and Gordon
            to jail. In February 2021, two wealthy airline pilots were offered the opportunity to acquire the remaining assets of BlueStar which had remained idle due to ownership, union disputes, hiring freezes and lack of capital to jump-start flights
            once again.
            <br><br> Korey and Alex acquired BlueStar at its lowest point in history and took 6 months to build it beyond what it ever was, spanning North America and Europe, serving dozens of destinations.
